title: Why am I even doing this?

One of these days I was working with brilinat team of young engineers, who despite being good professionals knew nothing aobut the discipline I started to fell in love with back then: functional programming. They tend to write software in old good imperative way and seem not to pay attention to my efforts in introducing functional concepts. What I realised quickly is that they just never heard about FP nor met someone who could explain this approach and its benefits. 

So I set myself a goal: I will be their teacher and togheter we will grow our functional skills to match those of programming gods. Easier said then done. When I started preparing "lessons" for them one "minor" obstacle got in my way: my knowledge was too incomplete and disperesed. I was not able to prepare a single session that was comprehensive and valuable. Well, time to change the strategy then. I need to educate myself first.

Some time later I decided to leave that company, but my mission was far from over and I needed new ways of communication with my former team. In the meanwhile I've met and discovered a lot more people who just never had a chance to read about FP in comprehensive way and just put label #sorcery on it never giving it a try. 

So here I am. Learning. Teaching maybe. Preaching for sure. Exploring to make my grow my own understanding of functional programming and trying to help people already discouraged to find place for it in thier toolbox. I hope it will make all of us better engineers. 

Functional adventure awaits!
