title: Why am I even doing this?

One of these days I was working with a brilliant team of young engineers, who despite being good professionals knew nothing about the discipline I started to fell in love with back then: functional programming. They tend to write software in an old good imperative way and seem not to pay attention to my efforts in introducing functional concepts. What I realized quickly is that they just never heard about FP nor met someone who could explain this approach and its benefits. 

So I set myself a goal: I will be their teacher and togheter we will grow our functional skills to match those of programming gods. Easier said than done. When I started preparing the "lessons" one "minor" obstacle got in my way: my knowledge was too incomplete and dispersed. I was not able to prepare a single session that was comprehensive and valuable. Well, time to change the strategy then. I need to educate myself first.

Sometime later I decided to leave that company, but my mission was far from over and I needed new ways of communication with my former team. In meanwhile, I've met and discovered a lot more people who just never had a chance to read about FP comprehensively and just put label #sorcery on it never giving it a try. 

So here I am. Learning. Teaching maybe. Preaching for sure. Exploring to make me grow my own understanding of functional programming and trying to help people already discouraged to find a place for it in their toolbox. I hope it will make all of us better engineers. 

Functional adventure awaits!
